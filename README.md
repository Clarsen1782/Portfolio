## Usage 

Greetings! I'm Christina Larsen, a recent graduate of the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Web Development Certification course (December 2023). Welcome to my React-Bootstrap portfolio, a snapshot of the skills and knowledge I've gained on my journey into web development.

While this portfolio represents just the beginning of my learning, it serves as a comprehensive overview of the diverse skills I've acquired. I'm excited about the prospect of expanding this page with new projects as I continue to grow in the field.

Thank you for exploring my portfolio, and I look forward to sharing more of my coding adventures with you in the future!
